## Methods
### _constructor(options)_
`new MorsePlayer(options)` : options are the same as those used in the [attribute section](#attributes).

### async play(text)
`play` method start the morse playing of the text. The text can be passed in parameter otherwise it's come from `Text` property and is cleaned. The method returns a promise wich is fulfilled at the first pause or at the end of the playing.
```Javascript
await player.play('test');
await player.play('this text is read after the first has finished');
```
_Note_ : `play()` automatically pauses others instances of MorsePlayer on the page

### pause()
stops the playing

### stop()
stops the playing and reset the current playing time

### playBoop()
play a 'boop' sound (used for wrong entry in simple mode)

### addEventListener(event_name, func) / on(event_name, func)
Register an event listener
```Javascript
player.addEventListener('play', () => {
    console.log('CW Time !');
});
player.addEventListener('parameterchanged', (param) => {
    console.log(`"${param}" changed to ${player[param]}`);
});
```
#### Supported events
 - `parameterchanged` : one of the properties of the player has changed. The parameter's name is passed as argument with the event.
 - `indexchanged` : the current index in the input text changed. **Warning** the index reference the `Text` property, which is cleaned (and thus can be different from original provided text)
 - `play` : playing has started or been resumed from pause
 - `pause` : playing has been temporarily stopped
 - `stop` : playing has been definitely stopped

### removeEventListener(event_name, func?) / removeEventListener(func)
